# Linux Foundations – Learning Journey 

Welcome to my **Linux Foundations** learning repository.  
This repo documents my journey as I build a strong foundation in Linux for cybersecurity, penetration testing, and system administration.  

The goal is not just to collect commands, but to create a **structured, professional reference** that demonstrates both learning progress and practical application.

##  Why This Repository?

Linux is at the heart of servers, cloud platforms, and cybersecurity labs.  
As part of my learning path, I am:  
- Documenting commands and concepts in **clear, structured notes**  
- Practicing with **interactive labs (LabEx, local VMs, HackTheBox, VulnHub)**  
- Writing small **Bash scripts** to automate tasks  
- Recording my progress like a **developer’s logbook**

This makes the repo both a **personal study resource** and a **portfolio for others to follow along**.
